BeachHacks  (April 2 - April 3, 2016)

	During this Hackathon, I attempted to create a mini Music Player that had the ability to play a select number of songs.

	The Program would run as a GuiApp and display the Song that would be currently playing.

	The User would be able to Play and Pause the Song as well as skip to the next or previous song.

	The User also had the option to enable a shuffle functionality that would play the next song in sequence at random.

	Furthermore, the User could ultimately stop playback of the song and exit the Program.

	The Desktop application was able to be completed with minor bugs and a couple of formatting issues that can be fixed if needed.


	The team had plans to also create an Android Application of the same concept, but failed to do so in this Hackathon.
	However, the creator of this Project will consider working on this part of the Project in the future.
